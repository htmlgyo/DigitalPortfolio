        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Direction: Write a one-paragraph (approximately 10 sentences) summary of the reading selection. It should include the title of the reading 
            selection, the author’s name, author’s thesis, and supporting points.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The article titled "Dependence: Do We Ultimately Need Technology?" highlights the widening gap of dependence</b> 
            ce on technology and its
negative effects on society at large. The author notes how very often simple mental work such as figuring out basic math is now often
outsourced to electronic devices. There has been a loss of agility resulting from all this. A certain article Brown cites indicates that according to a
study conducted by University College London (UCL), it is proven that overuse of GPS navigation is detrimental for the brain's hippocampus,
which is responsible for memory and spatial awareness. <b> Brown denotes in the work the aspect of technology penetrating the business world:
    forgetting about the key information because of dependence on digital storage can lead to monetary losses.</b>In fact, it points to "digital
    amnesia," a term that Kaspersky has coined for the way people leave all the information to be stored by technology for them to remember it.<b>The article further talks about risks in the medical field. Surgeons may lose some manual skills because of frequent robotic procedures
        performed in future. Brown further stresses the balance: productivity and efficiency gain from technology are balanced by detrimental
        dependence on them, leaving one with hampered cognitive-bit practical abilities.
        </b>

        <h1>Response</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Direction: Write a one-paragraph (approximately 10 sentences) response to the reading selection. It should include your reaction to the 
            author’s thesis, and assessment of author’s achievement of the text’s purpose, clarity, and objectivity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article by Terry Brown bring to light some possibility of disadvantages of overt dependence on technology. I do agree with his thesis that
            while technology promotes efficiency, it could simultaneously erode our mental and manual faculties. The author gives convincing evidence such
            as the study done by UCL on the activity of the hippocampus and Kaspersky's study on digital amnesia to show how technology has rendered us
            less able to memorize and think. His examples from the medical and business sectors highlight the fact that such dependence has very serious
            real-world consequences. The writing is lucid, impartial, and research-backed, all of which further strengthen the author's argument. He could
            have gone further and mentioned possible solutions to lessen the negative impacts other than acknowledging the positives of technology.
            Generally, the article does well to articulate the idea that while technology is very much involved in one way or another in modern life, being
            engaged mentally and practically is just as important so as not to be overdependent on it and avoid its risks.
